							What I have learnt from this assignment in particular is that I definitely have unlocked a great interest in Human-Computer Interaction; particularly in how we interact physically through input devices. For this reason, I am glad that Farley and I managed to think of a research topic that we are both interested in; all as well as being able to integrate or software development skills in designing and building our test app. I am also disappointed in myself for not allowing myself more time for extra research in preparation for the experiment, as I feel that with more preparation we could have improved our knowledge particularly of the role that Fitts’ Law plays in our research question; and knowing what we now know, I think that if we redesigned and better planned the experiment to do it again, we could certainly find statistically conclusive results.
						</p>
						<p>
							On the topic of statistics, I have learnt a great amount, although I realized that I have a lot to learn before I conduct a statistical analysis of a similar scale. My understanding of the results was greatly shaped by some last-minute learning which might have come across as poorly articulated analysis; in comparison to how it sounded in my head.
						</p>
						<p>
							In relating my overall experience in Applied HCI to my understanding of HCI before this semester, I now have a lot of meaningful process to add to both the remainder of my undergraduate study, and my work as a junior software developer with a local company in the Bay of Plenty.
						</p>
						<p>
							Particularly in my key development role in my Research & Development, I can see that while my project’s software development will not involve any user interface, my final portfolio, similarly to this website, will need to be kept as usable as possible to appropriately display the work of my group. I think that similarly to with this site, I will try to make a responsive website using Materialize CSS as a method of bootstrapping our website to keep a clean and consistent design. I will also make sure that we take heuristics into account when designing the website.
						</p>
						<p>
							Taking the role of sole web developer for a modern Angular app in my summer job, I will now be able to introduce many HCI considerations I can make when conversing with stakeholders and our product owner. Since I already had noticed a number of usability issues, I hope that my new knowledge of concepts like Nielsen's Heuristics will help me to develop more usable interfaces.

							The Fitts law experiment for Human Computer Interaction (HCI) was the first usability test/experiment that I have ever conducted, and as such there were many things that we could improve upon, as well as things that we did quite well. When I first received this assignment I felt quite overwhelmed due to the amount of work that seemed to be involved, as well as the fact that I had never done anything like this before so I did not know where or how to begin. I decided to pair up with Kevin because we had worked together on previous software projects and I think we work well together naturally. I also thought that working in a small group of two people would be easier to manage. I think that this assumption was correct however I did not take into consideration that having a group of only 2 members meant that balancing the workload becomes a lot more difficult. Beginning this project, we decided that we wanted to pick a topic that would benefit us from knowing the results, or proving our hypothesis, as well as something a little more interesting than just comparing websites or mice. I am glad that we decided to explore the world of Fitts law and how different input devices vary in efficiency because as a software developer who enjoys designing user interfaces for laptops and mobile devices, knowing more about the science behind where to place objects and the layout of objects in my designs will benefit me immensely. Conducting the experiment was difficult because I found it hard locating research on experiments in a similar vein. Luckily, I was able to find a resource which outlined the way that Paul Fitts originally conducted his experiment, and based on that I was able to create a test application (that can be found <a href=”experiments.html”>here</a> ). This application had its downfalls that I outline in the conclusion, but on the positive side it was a fun test to create and I think it was enjoyable for our participants too. Although we started the assignment a little later than the rest of the class, we finished strong - I think the greatest part of our study is the way that we represent our results in a clean website with a lot of supporting analysis and study.
						</p>
						<p>
							Looking forward, I can already see plenty of applications for my new found knowledge. Creating applications for users is what I see myself doing in the future as a career and having a strong understanding of usability concepts will definitely aid me in creating systems that give users value and which are easy and intuitive for them to use. I enjoyed how this paper allowed me to gain a broad understanding of a lot of scientific topics even if I am only really talking about a small part of them, HCI encourages you to explore the science behind the simple things and that is something I really enjoy.
						</p>
						<p>
							Also, I found it great having labs readily available for people struggling with the assignment. Kevin and I used this opportunity to our advantage multiple times and were able to be firmly placed back on track by the teaching staff. Overall, this was a great experience and I feel as if I learnt a lot more than I initially thought I would about the fascinating world of HCI.
