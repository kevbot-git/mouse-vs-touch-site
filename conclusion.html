						<h5>Final Thoughts</h5>
						<p>As we can see by our analysis, as the size (radius) of the object being pressed enlarges, touching it gets significantly easier (measured by speed/time taken to touch) however, smaller objects especially those ~25 pixels or less in radius become much harder to press. We predict that this finding is the result of the size of a participant’s finger being larger than the object they are trying to press, which results in an inability to see the object and less precision. Based on this, we suggest that interface designers use ~25 pixels as a lower bound when creating components such as clickable buttons for touch displays. </p>
						<p>Another discovery we found when analysing our findings was that displacement between objects didn’t appear to be statistically significant. If you are using touch input or a mouse, you are most likely not going to see any significant speed increases by placing objects closer together. Keep in mind though that this is obviously untrue if the elements separated are to be pressed multiple times in quick succession, in this case, the distance between each element is very important in speed. This may suggest however that designers positioning important elements on an interface that are meant to be clicked once (save or exit buttons) can place them away from the main area of focus on the screen without wasting the user’s time. Also, we must note that these findings are based on data received from a laptop with the screen resolution of 1366x768 and could be untrue for any device larger than that. An interesting change to our test to see if these findings are concrete would be to change the screen size (or the container the game is in) and check to see how this difference affects our results.</p>

						<h5>Aspects that could be improved</h5>
						<p>A factor that we did not consider when conducting this experiment was reaction time and the cons of using randomised factors (displacement and size). In our analysis phase, we didn’t count reaction time as a variable because it is almost impossible to measure, therefore our data could be swayed by the possibility that people react to things at totally different rates than others. In Fitts’ original tests, and also on many online Fitts law tests, they remove this variable by making the next circle or column to touch visible at all times. Doing this in our own test would have made the results that we received much more reliable. We also made analysis more difficult by randomising the displacement between two objects, to mitigate this issue it would have been a better idea to have a constant distance between two objects and alternate or randomise the rotation.</p>
						<p>Something interesting that we didn’t initially take into consideration while undertaking our experiment was the Hawthorne Effect and how it could have an impact on our results. The Hawthorne effect states that under observation, participants may undertake tasks or act differently to how they would if they knew they weren’t being monitored. During our experiment, we noticed that the application we developed had a bug that would cease displaying circles for the user to click. If this happened to a participant during a real experiment, the data would have to be deleted and the test restarted. Because of this, we thought it would be best for us to stand near the participant and watch to see how they were progressing. Consequently, our data could be inaccurate if the effect was present as the user could have felt pressured to complete the test as quickly as possible, and not interacted with the device as naturally as they would have without our presence.
						<p>Another aspect of our test that we could possibly improve on in the future would be to run our experiment on a desktop computer, or simply a device that had a stable screen. The laptop that we used for testing had an unsecure screen which would wobble back and forth. Because we were testing for variables such as speed and accuracy, having this issue throughout our study could have given us inaccurate results.</p>
