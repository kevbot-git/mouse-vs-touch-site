						<h5>Cons</h5>
						<p>A factor that we did not consider when conducting this experiment was reaction time and the cons of using randomised factors (displacement and size). In our analysis phase, we didn’t count reaction time as a variable because it is almost impossible to measure, therefore our data could be swayed by the possibility that people react to things at totally different rates than others. In Fitts’ original tests, and also on many online Fitts law tests, they remove this variable by making the next circle or column to touch visible at all times. Doing this in our own test would have made the results that we received much more reliable. We also made analysis more difficult by randomising the displacement between two objects, to mitigate this issue it would have been a better idea to have a constant distance between two objects and alternate or randomise the rotation.</p>
						<p>Something interesting that we didn’t initially take into consideration while undertaking our experiment was the Hawthorne Effect and how it could have an impact on our results. The Hawthorne effect states that under observation, participants may undertake tasks or act differently to how they would if they knew they weren’t being monitored. During our experiment, we noticed that the application we developed had a bug that would cease displaying circles for the user to click. If this happened to a participant during a real experiment, the data would have to be deleted and the test restarted. Because of this, we thought it would be best for us to stand near the participant and watch to see how they were progressing. Consequently, our data could be inaccurate if the effect was present as the user could have felt pressured to complete the test as quickly as possible, and not interacted with the device as naturally as they would have without our presence.
