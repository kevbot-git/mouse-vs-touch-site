						<h4>Introduction</h4>
						<p>
							UI design has come a long way from early computers such as the Xerox PARC to today's elegant
							Macintosh interfaces. Over time we have optimized user interfaces to maximize visual appeal and
							functional usability, thanks to findings by the likes of Paul Fitts and Jakob Nielsen.
							This website is an interactive report based on a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) study carried out by
							AUT students Farley Schaefer and Kevin Menhinick. The study aims to answer the above research question;
							hopefully for the purpose of serving as a reference for developers or UI designers when considering
							pointing aspects of interaction with their UIs.
						</p>

						<p>
							This study will consist of an experiment in which we will be following quantitative methods to gain insight around our research question. Using a quantitative study as opposed to a qualitative one seemed pragmatic to us due to the analytical nature of the experiment, and because we are gaining metrics (speed and accuracy) that don’t exceed physical and reactive boundaries, we have more to gain from studying a large quantity of participants rather than deeply analysing a select few.

						<h4>Purpose</h4>
						<p>
							The purpose of this study is to look at the relationship between a target’s size and screen
							position, and each input method’s efficiency in pointing to the target (in terms of time taken to
							point to and click); and to find out how the connection differs for each. We will have to design and carry out an abstract experiment that will produce
							results appropriate to be generalized; thus allowing them to potentially be used for a sort of benchmark
							for UI design as a whole.
						</p>
						<p>
							We hope that we can draw conclusions from our findings that give UI designers looking at our research some things to consider when attempting to create their next user interface. We will do this by exploring our data and explaining how it relates to design principles such as positioning, spacing and layout of objects on a screen.
